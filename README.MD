Simple code completion, go to reference from `<template>`. It based on outline and works with either [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) or [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) installed (uses document features).

Note that I'm currently trying to create more convenient and reliable extension for Vue2: [Volar Extended](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zardoy.testPatched1).

## Why?

It was mainly created for Vue@2, where just `export default` is used within components.

Vetur is abandoned. It just doesn't work in some components.
Volar doesn't work without `defineComponent` and some switches that must be defined in js/tsconfig locally.
